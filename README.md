# Coding-Sequence-optimization-for-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii
This program provides an implementation for carrying out the sequence optimization described in:  'Enhancing Heterologous Expression in C. reinhardtii by Transcript Sequence Optimization' Weiner et al., The Plant Journal, 2018   This is a standalone application for optimizing DNA sequences meant for achieving high expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  The fascinating Chlamydomonas picture used as this app's logo was taken by Gerd Guenther: (https://www.allposters.com/-st/Gerd-Guenther-Posters_c180530_.htm)
