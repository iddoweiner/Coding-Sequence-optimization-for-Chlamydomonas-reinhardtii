# Coding-Sequence-optimization-for-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii
This program provides an implementation for carrying out the sequence optimization described in:  
1. For nuclear expression: Enhancing Heterologous Expression in C. reinhardtii by Transcript Sequence Optimization, Weiner et al., The Plant Journal, 2018
2. For chloroplast expression: CSO â€“ a sequence optimization software for engineering chloroplast expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Weiner et al., under review 

This is a standalone application for optimizing DNA sequences meant for achieving high expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
